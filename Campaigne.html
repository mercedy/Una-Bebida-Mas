<h2>Media Tactics</h2>
<p>We chose online marketing for our brand because of the low costs in comparison of people reached with the campaign and as previously mentioned our target audience is heavy social media users. We used two social media platforms, Instagram and TikTok. In 2020 most used social media platforms amongst millennials Instagram took 4th place and TikTok only 9th . (See appendix nr.4) Most respondents did say that despite that Facebook ranks as the second-most popular social media platform, they use Facebook much less than they used to. While usage of Instagram has rapidly increased over the years. As for TikTok in 2020 it had just launched and already ranked higher than other social media platforms that had been there for years.  As a new brand our main objective is to send out our message to as many people as possible therefore, we chose platforms where you can do that the best. TikTok videos will help us to reach large number of people without having followers. Same for Instagram reels. Content quality and brand interactivity both have a positive and significant impact on brand awareness, however the effect of content quality is stronger.(7) Therefore, it will be crucial to make our content original and good quality. Later on, we will post a giveaway on both platforms to engage followers in order to gain people attention and make our campaign more engaging for consumers. We will also use most used hashtags in both platforms to help reach more people. As for TikTok we will choose popular and at that time “trendy” sounds.</p>

<h2>Learning points</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Throughout the campaign we struggled with keeping up with our content calendar. It took much more time to make qualitative posts then we first thought. We didn’t complete two out of three of our reach objectives – 100 followers on Instagram, 4000views on TikTok in total. We had 33 followers on Instagram and 782 views in total for our tree TikTok posts. Although we did reach the objective for 2000 views on Instagram reels, we got 3135 views. Because of time limitation we didn’t make enough posts to build engaging followers, we had 50 followers at first but then many of them unfollowed. We did make successful Instagram reel with reaching 3014accounts. But the second one fell flat with having no views at all. From that we learned that it is crucial to post the reel in the feed as a post as well. The use of hashtags worked quite well, for our first TikTok we got 489 views without using a well-known TikTok sound, only three hashtags, two of them being most used in TikTok. For our next two we had 146 views for each. We believe, that those two didn’t get as many views because they were posted in different time, earlier in the day. There wasn’t a lot that went as expected, there was a lot of milestones and mistakes to learn from. The first one being not enough posts. Now we would create more and pay more attention to the time when posting our content. One thing that went as expected was delivering high quality content, sending a clear message and being consistent with our design that closely reflected our brand identity.</p>
